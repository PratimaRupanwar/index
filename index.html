Initialize a Docker Swarm on a Node:

Initialize a Docker Swarm on a node to make it a swarm manager.
bash
Copy code
sudo docker swarm init --advertise-addr <MANAGER-IP>
Replace <MANAGER-IP> with the IP address of the node that will act as the manager.
Joining Nodes to the Swarm:

Once you have initialized a swarm, you can join worker or manager nodes to it.
bash
Copy code
sudo docker swarm join --token <TOKEN> <MANAGER-IP>:<PORT>
Replace <TOKEN> with the token generated during docker swarm init.
Replace <MANAGER-IP> with the IP address of the swarm manager.
Replace <PORT> with the port number (default is 2377).
Managing Nodes:
List Nodes in the Swarm:

View the list of nodes in the Docker Swarm.
bash
Copy code
sudo docker node ls
Inspect a Node:

Get detailed information about a specific node in the swarm.
bash
Copy code
sudo docker node inspect <NODE-ID>
Replace <NODE-ID> with the ID or name of the node.
Promote a Worker to Manager:

Promote a worker node to become a manager in the swarm.
bash
Copy code
sudo docker node promote <NODE-ID>
Replace <NODE-ID> with the ID or name of the worker node.
Demote a Manager to Worker:

Demote a manager node to become a worker in the swarm.
bash
Copy code
sudo docker node demote <NODE-ID>
Replace <NODE-ID> with the ID or name of the manager node.
Remove a Node from the Swarm:

Remove a node from the Docker Swarm.
bash
Copy code
sudo docker node rm <NODE-ID>
Replace <NODE-ID> with the ID or name of the node to remove.
Managing Services:
Deploying Services:

Deploy a service in the Docker Swarm.
bash
Copy code
sudo docker service create --name <SERVICE-NAME> <IMAGE>
Replace <SERVICE-NAME> with the desired name for your service.
Replace <IMAGE> with the Docker image name and optionally the tag (e.g., nginx:latest).
Listing Services:

List all services running in the Docker Swarm.
bash
Copy code
sudo docker service ls
Inspecting a Service:

Get detailed information about a specific service in the Docker Swarm.
bash
Copy code
sudo docker service inspect <SERVICE-ID>
Replace <SERVICE-ID> with the ID or name of the service.
Scaling a Service:

Scale a service by increasing or decreasing the number of replicas (tasks).
bash
Copy code
sudo docker service scale <SERVICE-ID>=<NUMBER-OF-REPLICAS>
Replace <SERVICE-ID> with the ID or name of the service.
Replace <NUMBER-OF-REPLICAS> with the desired number of replicas.
Updating a Service:

Update the configuration of a service in the Docker Swarm.
bash
Copy code
sudo docker service update --image <NEW-IMAGE> <SERVICE-ID>
Replace <NEW-IMAGE> with the new Docker image name and optionally the tag.
Replace <SERVICE-ID> with the ID or name of the service to update.
Removing a Service:

Remove a service from the Docker Swarm.
bash
Copy code
sudo docker service rm <SERVICE-ID>
Replace <SERVICE-ID> with the ID or name of the service to remove.
Other Commands:
